    <h1 class="sgc8" id="heading_id_2">Through the Trapdoor</h1>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"> </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">In years to come, Harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment. Yet the days crept by, and there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">It was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers. They had been given special, new quills for the exams, which had been bewitched with an Anti-Cheating spell.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">They had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tap-dance across a desk. Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox — points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers. Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest. Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldn’t sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by his old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Maybe it was because they hadn’t seen what Harry had seen in the <span class="GramE1">forest,</span> or because they didn’t have scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron and Hermione didn’t seem as worried about the Stone as Harry. The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them, but he didn’t keep visiting them in dreams, and they were so busy with their studying they didn’t have much time to fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Their very last exam was History of Magic. One hour of answering questions about batty old wizards who’d invented self-stirring cauldrons and they’d be free, free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out. When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment, Harry couldn’t help cheering with the rest.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“That was far easier than I thought it would be,” said Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds. “I needn’t have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Hermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but Ron said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“No more studying,” Ron sighed happily, stretching out on the grass. “You could look more cheerful, Harry, we’ve got a week before we find out how badly we’ve done, there’s no need to worry yet.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry was rubbing his forehead.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“I wish I knew what this <i class="calibre1">means</i>!” he burst out angrily. “My scar keeps hurting — it’s happened before, but never as often as this.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Go to Madam Pomfrey,” Hermione suggested.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“I’m not ill,” said Harry. “I think it’s a warning … it means danger’s coming. …”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Ron couldn’t get worked up, it was too hot.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Harry, relax, Hermione’s right, the Stone’s safe as long as Dumbledore’s around. Anyway, we’ve never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy. He nearly had his leg ripped off <span class="GramE1">once,</span> he’s not going to try it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry nodded, but he couldn’t shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he’d forgotten to do, something important. When he tried to explain this, Hermione said, “That’s just the exams. I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we’d done that one.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling</span> <span class="sgc6">didn’t have anything to do with work, though. He watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth. Hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters. Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore. Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy … never … but —</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry suddenly jumped to his feet.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Where’re you going?” said Ron sleepily.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“I’ve just thought of something,” said Harry. He had turned white. “We’ve got to go and see Hagrid, now.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Why?” panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Don’t you think it’s a bit odd,” said Harry, scrambling up the grassy slope, “that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket? How many people wander around with dragon eggs if it’s against wizard law? Lucky they found Hagrid, don’t you think? Why didn’t I see it before?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“What are you talking about?” said Ron, but Harry, sprinting across the grounds toward the forest, didn’t answer.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; his trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas into a large bowl.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Hullo,” he said, smiling. “Finished yer exams? Got time fer a drink?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Yes, please,” said Ron, but Harry cut him off.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“No, we’re in a hurry. Hagrid, I’ve got to ask you something. You know that night you won Norbert? What did the stranger you were playing cards with look like?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Dunno,” said Hagrid casually, “he wouldn’ take his cloak off.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“It’s not that unusual, yeh get a lot o’ funny folk in the Hog’s Head — that’s one o’ the pubs down in the village. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn’ he? I never saw his face, he kept his hood up.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry sank down next to the bowl of peas.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“What did you talk to him about, Hagrid? Did you mention Hogwarts at all?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Mighta come up,” said Hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember. “Yeah … he asked what I did, an’ I told him I was gamekeeper here. … He asked a bit about the sorta creatures I look after … so I told him … an’ I said what I’d always really wanted was a dragon … an’ then … I can’ remember too well, ’cause he kept buyin’ me drinks. … Let’s see … yeah, then he said he had the dragon egg an’ we could play cards fer it if I wanted … but he had ter be sure I could handle it, he didn’ want it ter go ter any old home. … So I told him, after Fluffy, a dragon would be easy. …”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“And did he — did he seem interested in Fluffy?” Harry asked, trying to keep his voice calm.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Well — yeah — how many three-headed dogs d’yeh meet, even around Hogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy’s a piece o’ cake if yeh know how to calm him down, jus’ play him a bit o’ music an’ he’ll go straight off ter sleep —”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Hagrid suddenly looked horrified.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“I shouldn’ta told yeh that!” he blurted out. “Forget I said it! Hey — where’re yeh goin’?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry, Ron, and Hermione didn’t speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“We’ve got to go to Dumbledore,” said Harry. “Hagrid told that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak — it must’ve been easy, once he’d got Hagrid drunk. I just hope Dumbledore believes us. Firenze might back us up if Bane doesn’t stop him. Where’s Dumbledore’s office?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">They looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction. They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“We’ll just have to —” Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang across the hall.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“What are you three doing inside?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">It was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“We want to see Professor Dumbledore,” said Hermione, rather bravely, Harry and Ron thought.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“See Professor Dumbledore?” Professor McGonagall repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do. “Why?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry swallowed — now what?</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“It’s sort of secret,” he said, but he wished at once he hadn’t, because Professor McGonagall’s nostrils flared.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,” she said coldly. “He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at once.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“He’s <i class="calibre1">gone</i>?” said Harry frantically. <span class="GramE1">“<i class="calibre1">Now</i>?”</span></span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, <span class="GramE1">Potter,</span> he has many demands on his time —”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“But this is important.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic, Potter?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Look,” said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, “Professor — it’s about the Sorcerer’s Stone —”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn’t that. The books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn’t pick them up.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“How do you know <span class="GramE1">— ?</span>” she spluttered.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Professor, I think — I <i class="calibre1">know</i> — that Sn— that someone’s going to try and steal the Stone. I’ve got to talk to Professor Dumbledore.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">She eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,” she said finally. “I don’t know how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal it, it’s too well protected.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“But Professor —”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Potter, I know what I’m talking about,” she said shortly. She bent down and gathered up the fallen books. “I suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">But they didn’t.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“It’s tonight,” said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall was out of earshot. “Snape’s going through the trapdoor tonight. He’s found out everything he needs, and now he’s got Dumbledore out of the way. He sent that <span class="GramE1">note,</span> I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns up.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“But what can <span class="GramE1">we</span> —”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Hermione gasped. Harry and Ron wheeled round.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Snape was standing there.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Good afternoon,” he said smoothly.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">They stared at him.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“You shouldn’t be inside on a day like this,” he said, with an odd, twisted smile.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“We were —” Harry began, without any idea what he was going to say.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“You want to be more careful,” said Snape. “Hanging around like this, people will think you’re up to something. And Gryffindor really can’t afford to lose any more points, can it?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry flushed. They turned to go outside, but Snape called them back.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Be warned, Potter — any more nighttime wanderings and I will personally make sure you are expelled. Good day to you.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">He strode off in the direction of the staffroom.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Out on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Right, here’s what we’ve got to do,” he whispered urgently. “One of us has got to keep an eye on Snape — wait outside the staffroom and follow him if he leaves it. Hermione, you’d better do that.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="GramE3">“Why me?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“It’s obvious,” said Ron. “You can pretend to be waiting for Professor Flitwick, you know.” He put on a high voice, <span class="GramE1">“ ‘Oh</span> Professor Flitwick, I’m so worried, I think I got question fourteen <i class="calibre1">b</i> wrong. …’ ”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Oh, shut up,” said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out for Snape.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“And we’d better stay outside the third-floor corridor,” Harry told Ron. “Come on.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">But that part of the plan didn’t work. No sooner had they reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor McGonagall turned up again and this time, she lost her temper.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“I suppose you think you’re harder to get past than a pack of enchantments!” she stormed. <span class="GramE1">“Enough of this nonsense!</span> If I hear you’ve come anywhere near here again, I’ll take another fifty points from Gryffindor! <span class="GramE1">Yes, Weasley, from my own House!”</span></span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry and Ron went back to the common room. Harry had just said, “At least Hermione’s on Snape’s tail,” when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“I’m sorry, Harry!” she wailed. “Snape came out and asked me what I was doing, so I said I was waiting for Flitwick, and Snape went to get him, and I’ve only just got away, I don’t know where Snape went.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Well, that’s it then, isn’t it?” Harry said.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">The other two stared at him. He was pale and his eyes were <span class="GramE1">glittering</span>.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“I’m going out of here tonight and I’m going to try and get to the Stone first.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“You’re mad!” said Ron.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“You can’t!” said Hermione. <span class="GramE1">“After what McGonagall and Snape have said?</span> You’ll be expelled!”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="GramE3">“SO WHAT?”</span> <span class="sgc6">Harry shouted. “Don’t you understand? If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort’s coming back! Haven’t you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over? There won’t be any Hogwarts to get expelled from! He’ll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts! Losing points doesn’t matter anymore, can’t you see? D’you <span class="GramE1">think</span> he’ll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the House Cup? If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I’ll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there, it’s only dying a bit later than I would have, because I’m never going over to the Dark Side! I’m going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me! Voldemort killed my parents, remember?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">He glared at them.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“You’re right, Harry,” said Hermione in a small voice.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“I’ll use the Invisibility Cloak,” said Harry. “It’s just lucky I got it back.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“But will it cover all three of us?” said Ron.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="GramE3">“All — all three of us?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Oh, come off it, you don’t think we’d let you go alone?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Of course not,” said Hermione briskly. “How do you think you’d get to the Stone without us? I’d better go and look through my books, there might be something useful. …”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“But if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Not if I can help it,” said Hermione grimly. “Flitwick told me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam. They’re not throwing me out after that.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6"> </span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">After dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room. Nobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry any more, after all. This was the first night he hadn’t been upset by it. Hermione was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break. Harry and Ron didn’t talk much. Both of them were thinking about what they were about to do.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Slowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Better get the cloak,” Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left, stretching and yawning. Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory. He pulled out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given him for Christmas. He pocketed it to use on Fluffy — he didn’t feel much like singing.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">He ran back down to the common room.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“We’d better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of us — if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own —”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“What are you doing?” said a voice from the corner of the room. Neville appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who looked as though he’d been making another bid for freedom.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Nothing, Neville, nothing,” said Harry, hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Neville stared at their guilty faces.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“You’re going out again,” he said.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“No, no, no,” said Hermione. “No, we’re not. Why don’t you go to bed, Neville?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door. They couldn’t afford to waste any more time, Snape might even now be playing Fluffy to sleep.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“You can’t go out,” said Neville, “you’ll be caught again. Gryffindor will be in even more trouble.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“You don’t understand,” said Harry, “this is important.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">But Neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“I won’t let you do it,” he said, hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole. “I’ll — I’ll fight you!”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“<i class="calibre1">Neville,</i>” Ron exploded, “get away from that hole and don’t be an idiot —”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Don’t you call me an idiot!” said Neville. “I don’t think you should be breaking any more rules! And you were the one who told me to stand up to people!”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Yes, but not to <i class="calibre1">us,</i>” said Ron in exasperation. “Neville, you don’t know what you’re doing.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">He took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, who leapt out of sight.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Go on then, try and hit me!” said Neville, raising his fists. “I’m ready!”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry turned to Hermione.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“<i class="calibre1">Do something,</i>” he said desperately.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Hermione stepped forward.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Neville,” she said, “I’m really, really sorry about this.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">She raised her wand.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“<i class="calibre1">Petrificus Totalus</i>!” she cried, pointing it at Neville.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Neville’s arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang together. His whole body rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a board.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Hermione ran to turn him over. Neville’s jaws were jammed together so he couldn’t speak. Only his eyes were moving, looking at them in horror.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“What’ve you done to him?” Harry whispered.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“It’s the full Body-Bind,” said Hermione miserably. “Oh, Neville, I’m so sorry.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“We had to, Neville, no time to explain,” said Harry.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“You’ll understand later, Neville,” said Ron as they stepped over him and pulled on the Invisibility Cloak.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn’t feel like a very good omen. In their nervous state, every statue’s shadow looked like Filch, every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on them.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">At the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs. Norris skulking near the top.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Oh, let’s kick her, just this once,” Ron whispered in Harry’s ear, but Harry shook his head. As they climbed carefully around her, Mrs. Norris turned her lamplike eyes on them, but didn’t do anything.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">They didn’t meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the third floor. Peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the carpet so that people would trip.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Who’s there?” he said suddenly as they climbed toward him. He narrowed his wicked black eyes. “Know you’re there, even if I can’t see you. Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">He rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Should call Filch, I should, if something’s a-creeping around unseen.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry had a sudden idea.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Peeves,” he said, in a hoarse whisper, “the Bloody Baron has his own reasons for being invisible.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Peeves almost fell out of the air in shock. He caught himself in time and hovered about a foot off the stairs.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, sir,” he said greasily. “My mistake, my mistake — I didn’t see you — of course I didn’t, you’re invisible — forgive old Peevsie his little joke, sir.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“I have business here, Peeves,” croaked Harry. “Stay away from this place tonight.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“I will, sir, I most certainly will,” said Peeves, rising up in the air again. “Hope your business goes well, Baron, I’ll not bother you.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">And he scooted off.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“<i class="calibre1">Brilliant,</i> Harry!” whispered Ron.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">A few seconds later, they were there, outside the third-floor corridor — and the door was already ajar.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Well, there you are,” Harry said quietly, “Snape’s already got past Fluffy.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them. Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other two.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“If you want to go back, I won’t blame you,” he said. “You can take the cloak, I won’t need it now.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Don’t be stupid,” said Ron.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“We’re coming,” said Hermione.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry pushed the door open.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">As the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears. All three of the dog’s noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it couldn’t see them.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“What’s that at its feet?” Hermione whispered.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Looks like a harp,” said Ron. “Snape must have left it there.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“It must wake up the moment you stop playing,” said Harry. “Well, here goes …”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">He put Hagrid’s flute to his lips and blew. It wasn’t really a tune, but from the first note the beast’s eyes began to droop. Harry hardly drew breath. Slowly, the dog’s growls ceased — it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Keep playing,” Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor. They could feel the dog’s hot, smelly breath as they approached the giant heads.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“I think we’ll be able to pull the door open,” said Ron, peering over the dog’s back. “Want to go first, Hermione?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“No, I don’t!”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="GramE3">“All right.”</span> <span class="sgc6">Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog’s legs. He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“What can you see?” Hermione said anxiously.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Nothing — just black — there’s no way of climbing down, we’ll just have to drop.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get his attention and pointed at himself.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“You want to go first? Are you sure?” said Ron. “I don’t know how deep this thing goes. Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry handed the flute over. In the few seconds’ silence, the dog growled and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it fell back into its deep sleep.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor. There was no sign of the bottom.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">He lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips. Then he looked up at Ron and said, “If anything happens to me, don’t follow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, right?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Right,” said Ron.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“See you in a minute, I hope. …”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">And Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down, down and —</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="GramE3">FLUMP.</span> <span class="sgc6">With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft. He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“<span class="GramE1">It’s</span> okay!” he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was the open trapdoor, “it’s a soft landing, you can jump!”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Ron followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“What’s this stuff?” were his first words.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it’s here to break the fall. Come on, Hermione!”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">The distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry’s other side.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“We must be miles under the school,” she said.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Lucky this plant thing’s here, really,” said Ron.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“<i class="calibre1">Lucky</i>!” shrieked Hermione. “Look at you both!”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant wound around them.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Stop moving!” Hermione ordered them. “I know what this is — it’s Devil’s Snare!”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Oh, I’m so glad we know what it’s called, that’s a great help,” snarled Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Shut up, I’m trying to remember how to kill it!” said Hermione.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Well, hurry up, I can’t breathe!” Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it curled around his chest.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Devil’s Snare, Devil’s Snare … what did Professor Sprout say? — <span class="GramE1">it</span> likes the dark and the damp —”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“So light a fire!” Harry choked.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="GramE3">“Yes — of course — but there’s no wood!”</span> <span class="sgc6">Hermione cried, wringing her hands.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“HAVE YOU GONE MAD?” Ron bellowed. “ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Oh, right!” said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it, muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on Snape at the plant. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth. Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself from their bodies, and they were able to pull free.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,” said Harry as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Yeah,” said Ron, “and lucky Harry doesn’t lose his head in a crisis — ‘there’s no wood,’ <i class="calibre1">honestly.</i>”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“This way,” said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the only way forward.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">All they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls. The passageway sloped downward, and Harry was reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the heart, he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards’ bank. If they met a dragon, a fully-grown dragon — Norbert had been bad enough …</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Can you hear something?” Ron whispered.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Do you think it’s a ghost?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“I don’t know … sounds like wings to me.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“There’s light ahead — I can see something moving.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">They reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. It was full of small, jewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room. On the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Do you think they’ll attack us if we cross the room?” said Ron.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Probably,” said Harry. “They don’t look very vicious, but I suppose if they all swooped down at once … well, there’s no other choice … I’ll run.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">He took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted across the room. He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second, but nothing happened. He reached the door untouched. He pulled the handle, but it was locked.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">The other two followed him. They tugged and heaved at the door, but it wouldn’t budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora Charm.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Now what?” said <span class="GramE1">Ron.</span></span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“These birds … they can’t be here just for decoration,” said Hermione.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">They watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering — <i class="calibre1">glittering</i>?</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“They’re not birds!” Harry said suddenly. “They’re <i class="calibre1">keys</i>! Winged keys — look carefully. So that must mean …” he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys. “… <span class="GramE1">yes</span> — look! Broomsticks! We’ve got to catch the key to the door!”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“But there are <i class="calibre1">hundreds</i> of them!”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Ron examined the lock on the door.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“We’re looking for a big, old-fashioned one — probably silver, like the handle.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">They each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed and snatched, but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century. He had a knack for spotting things other people didn’t. After a minute’s weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“That one!” he called to the others. “That big one — there — no, there — with bright blue wings — the feathers are all crumpled on one side.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“We’ve got to close in on it!” Harry called, not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing. “Ron, you come at it from above — Hermione, stay below and stop it from going down — and I’ll try and catch it. <span class="GramE1">Right, NOW!”</span></span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Ron dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Harry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one hand. Ron and Hermione’s cheers echoed around the high chamber.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">They landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in his hand. He rammed it into the lock and turned — it worked. The moment the lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very battered now that it had been caught twice.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Ready?” Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle. They nodded. He pulled the door open.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">The next chamber was so dark they couldn’t see anything at all. But as they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were the white pieces. Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered slightly — the towering white chessmen had no faces.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Now what do we do?” Harry whispered.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“It’s obvious, isn’t it?” said Ron. “We’ve got to play our way across the room.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Behind the white pieces they could see another door.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“How?” said Hermione <span class="GramE1">nervously.</span></span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“I think,” said Ron, “we’re going to have to be chessmen.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the <span class="GramE1">knights</span> horse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Do we — er — have to join you to get across?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">The black knight nodded. Ron turned to the other two.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“This needs thinking about. …” he said. “I suppose we’ve got to take the place of three of the black pieces. …”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think. Finally he said, “Now, don’t be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess —”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“We’re not offended,” said Harry quickly. “Just tell us what to do.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, you go there instead of that castle.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“What about you?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“I’m going to be a knight,” said Ron.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“White always plays first in chess,” said Ron, peering across the board. “Yes … look …”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">A white pawn had moved forward two squares.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Ron started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently wherever he sent them. Harry’s knees were trembling. What if they lost?</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Harry — <span class="GramE1">move</span> diagonally four squares to the right.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Their first real shock came when their other knight was taken. The white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he lay quite still, facedown.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Had to let that happen,” said Ron, looking shaken. “Leaves you free to take that bishop, Hermione, go on.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Every time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy. Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall. Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in danger. He himself darted around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“We’re nearly there,” he muttered suddenly. “Let me think — let me think …”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">The white queen turned her blank face toward him.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Yes …” said Ron softly, “it’s the only way … I’ve got to be taken.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“NO!” Harry and Hermione shouted.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“That’s chess!” snapped Ron. “You’ve got to make some sacrifices! I make my move and she’ll take me — that leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“But —”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Do you want to stop Snape or not?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Ron —”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Look, if you don’t hurry up, he’ll already have the Stone!”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">There was no alternative.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Ready?” Ron <span class="GramE1">called,</span> his face pale but determined. “Here I go — now, don’t hang around once you’ve won.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">He stepped forward, and the white queen pounced. She struck Ron hard across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor — Hermione screamed but stayed on her square — the white queen dragged Ron to one side. He looked as if he’d been knocked out.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Shaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">The white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry’s feet. They had won. The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear. With one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“What if he’s <span class="GramE1">— ?”</span></span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“He’ll be all right,” said Harry, trying to convince himself. “What do you reckon’s next?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“We’ve had Sprout’s, that was the Devil’s Snare; Flitwick must’ve put charms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive; that leaves Quirrell’s spell, and Snape’s …”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">They had reached another door.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="GramE3">“All right?”</span> <span class="sgc6">Harry whispered.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Go on.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry pushed it open.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">A disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull their robes up over their noses. Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of them, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out cold with a bloody lump on its head.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“I’m glad we didn’t have to fight that one,” Harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs. “Come on, I can’t breathe.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">He pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to look at what came next — but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Snape’s,” said Harry. “What do we have to do?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">They stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway. It wasn’t ordinary fire either; it was purple. At the same instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward. They were trapped.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Look!” Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles. Harry looked over her shoulder to read it:</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6"> </span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal6"><span class="sgc6">Danger lies before you, while safety lies behind,</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal6"><span class="sgc6">Two of us will help you, whichever you would find,</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal6"><span class="sgc6">One among us seven will let you move ahead,</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal6"><span class="sgc6">Another will transport the drinker back instead,</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal6"><span class="sgc6">Two among our number hold only nettle wine,</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal6"><span class="sgc6">Three of us are killers, waiting hidden in line.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal6"><span class="sgc6">Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore,</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal6"><span class="sgc6">To help you in your choice, we give you these clues four:</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal6"><span class="sgc6">First, however slyly the poison tries to hide</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal6"><span class="sgc6">You will always find some on nettle wine’s left side;</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal6"><span class="sgc6">Second, different are those who stand at either end,</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal6"><span class="sgc6">But if you would move onward, neither is your friend;</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal6"><span class="sgc6">Third, as you see clearly, all are different size,</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal6"><span class="sgc6">Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides;</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal6"><span class="sgc6">Fourth, the second left and the second on the right</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal6"><span class="sgc6">Are twins once you taste them, though different at first <span class="GramE1">sight.</span></span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6"> </span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw that she was smiling, the very last thing he felt like doing.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“<i class="calibre1">Brilliant,</i>” said Hermione. “This isn’t magic — it’s logic — a puzzle. A lot of the greatest wizards haven’t got an ounce of <span class="GramE1">logic,</span> they’d be stuck in here forever.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“But so will we, won’t we?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Of course not,” said Hermione. “Everything we need is here on this paper. Seven bottles: three are poison; two are wine; one will get us safely through the black fire, and one will get us back through the purple.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“But how do we know which to drink?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Give me a minute.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Hermione read the paper several times. Then she walked up and down the line of bottles, muttering to herself and pointing at them. At last, she clapped her hands.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Got it,” she said. “The smallest bottle will get us through the black fire — toward the Stone.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry looked at the tiny bottle.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“There’s only enough there for one of us,” he said. “That’s hardly one swallow.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">They looked at each other.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Which one will get you back through the purple flames?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“You drink that,” said Harry. “No, listen, get back and get Ron. Grab brooms from the flying-key room, they’ll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy — go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, <span class="GramE1">we</span> need him. I might be able to hold Snape off for a while, but I’m no match for him, really.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“But Harry — what if You-Know-Who’s with him?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Well — I was lucky once, wasn’t I?” said Harry, pointing at his scar. “I might get lucky again.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Hermione’s lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her arms around him.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="GramE3">“<i class="calibre1">Hermione</i>!”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Harry — you’re a great wizard, you know.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“I’m not as good as you,” said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of him.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Me!” said Hermione. <span class="GramE1">“Books!</span> And cleverness! There are more important things — friendship and bravery and — oh Harry — be <i class="calibre1">careful</i>!”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“You drink first,” said Harry. “You are sure which is which, aren’t you?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Positive,” said Hermione. She took a long drink from the round bottle at the end, and shuddered.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“It’s not poison?” said Harry anxiously.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“No — but it’s like ice.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="GramE3">“Quick, go, before it wears off.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Good luck — take care —”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“GO!”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle. He turned to face the black flames.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Here I come,” he said, and he drained the little bottle in one gulp.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">It was indeed as though ice was flooding his body. He put the bottle down and walked forward; he braced himself, saw the black flames licking his body, but couldn’t feel them — for a moment he could see nothing but dark fire — then he was on the other side, in the last chamber.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">There was already someone there — but it wasn’t Snape. It wasn’t even Voldemort.</span></p>
