    <p class="MsoNormal4"> </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Things couldn’t have been worse.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Filch took them down to Professor McGonagall’s study on the first floor, where they sat and waited without saying a word to each other. Hermione was trembling. Excuses, alibis, and wild cover-up stories chased each other around Harry’s brain, each more feeble than the last. He couldn’t see how they were going to get out of trouble this time. They were cornered. How could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak? There was no reason on earth that Professor McGonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of night, let alone being up the tallest Astronomy Tower, which was out-of-bounds except for classes. Add Norbert and the Invisibility Cloak, and they might as well be packing their bags already.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Had Harry thought that things couldn’t have been worse? He was wrong. When Professor McGonagall appeared, she was leading Neville.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Harry!” Neville burst out, the moment he saw the other two. “I was trying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying he was going to catch you, <span class="GramE1">he said you had a drag —</span>”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry shook his head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor McGonagall had seen. She looked more likely to breathe fire than Norbert as she towered over the three of them.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“I would never have believed it of any of you. Mr. Filch says you were up in the Astronomy Tower. It’s one o’clock in the morning. <i class="calibre1">Explain yourselves.</i>”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">It was the first time Hermione had ever failed to answer a teacher’s question. She was staring at her slippers, as still as a statue.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“I think I’ve got a good idea of what’s been going on,” said Professor McGonagall. “It doesn’t take a genius to work it out. You fed Draco Malfoy some cock-and-bull story about a dragon, trying to get him out of bed and into trouble. I’ve already caught him. I suppose you think it’s funny that Longbottom here heard the story and believed it, too?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry caught Neville’s eye and tried to tell him without words that this wasn’t true, because Neville was looking stunned and hurt. Poor, blundering Neville — Harry knew what it must have cost him to try and find them in the dark, to warn them.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“I’m disgusted,” said Professor McGonagall. <span class="GramE1">“Four students out of bed in one night!</span> I’ve never heard of such a thing before! You, Miss Granger, I thought you had more sense. As for you, Mr. Potter, I thought Gryffindor meant more to you than this. All three of you will receive detentions — yes, you too, Mr. Longbottom, <i class="calibre1">nothing</i> gives you the right to walk around school at night, especially these days, it’s very dangerous — and fifty points will be taken from Gryffindor.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“<i class="calibre1">Fifty</i>?” Harry gasped — they would lose the lead, the lead he’d won in the last Quidditch match.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Fifty points <i class="calibre1">each,</i>” said Professor McGonagall, breathing heavily through her long, pointed nose.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Professor — please —”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“You <i class="calibre1">can’t</i> —”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Don’t tell me what I can and can’t do, Potter. Now get back to bed, all of you. I’ve never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">A hundred and fifty points lost. That put Gryffindor in last place. In one night, they’d ruined any chance Gryffindor had had for the House Cup. Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach. How could they ever make up for this?</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry didn’t sleep all night. He could hear Neville sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours. Harry couldn’t think of anything to say to comfort him. He knew Neville, like himself, was dreading the dawn. What would happen when the rest of Gryffindor found out what they’d done?</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">At first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the House points the next day thought there’d been a mistake. How could they suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday? And then the story started to spread: Harry Potter, the famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch matches, had lost them all those points, him and a couple of other stupid first years.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">From being one of the most popular and admired people at the school, Harry was suddenly the most hated. Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs turned on him, because everyone had been longing to see Slytherin lose the House Cup. Everywhere Harry went, people pointed and didn’t trouble to lower their voices as they insulted him. Slytherins, on the other hand, clapped as he walked past them, whistling and cheering, “Thanks Potter, we owe you one!”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Only Ron stood by him.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“They’ll all forget this in a few weeks. Fred and George have lost loads of points in all the time they’ve been here, and people still like them.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“They’ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go, though, have they?” said Harry miserably.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Well — no,” Ron admitted.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">It was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harry swore to himself not to meddle in things that weren’t his business from now on. He’d had it with sneaking around and spying. He felt so ashamed of himself that he went to Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“<i class="calibre1">Resign</i>?” Wood thundered. “What good’ll that do? How are we going to get any points back if we can’t win at Quidditch?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">But even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the team wouldn’t speak to Harry during practice, and if they had to speak about him, they called him “the Seeker.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Hermione and Neville were suffering, too. They didn’t have as bad a time as Harry, because they weren’t as well-known, but nobody would speak to them, either. Hermione had stopped drawing attention to <span class="GramE1">herself</span> in class, keeping her head down and working in silence.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry was almost glad that the exams weren’t far away. All the studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery. He, Ron, and Hermione kept to themselves, working late into the night, trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions, learn charms and spells by heart, memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions. …</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Then, about a week before the exams were due to start, Harry’s new resolution not to interfere in anything that didn’t concern him was put to an unexpected test. Walking back from the library on his own one afternoon, he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead. As he drew closer, he heard Quirrell’s voice.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“No — no — not again, please —”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">It sounded as though someone was threatening him. Harry moved closer.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“All right — all right —” he heard Quirrell sob.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Next second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening his turban. He was pale and looked as though he was about to cry. He strode out of sight; Harry didn’t think Quirrell had even noticed him. He waited until Quirrell’s footsteps had disappeared, <span class="GramE1">then</span> peered into the classroom. It was empty, but a door stood ajar at the other end. Harry was halfway toward it before he remembered what he’d promised himself about not meddling.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">All the same, he’d have gambled twelve Sorcerer’s Stones that Snape had just left the room, and from what Harry had just heard, Snape would be walking with a new spring in his step — Quirrell seemed to have given in at last.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on Astronomy. Harry told them what he’d heard.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Snape’s done it, then!” said Ron. “If Quirrell’s told him how to break his Anti-Dark Force spell —”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“There’s still <span class="GramE1">Fluffy</span>, though,” said Hermione.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Maybe Snape’s found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid,” said Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them. “I bet there’s a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three-headed dog. So what do we do, Harry?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">The light of adventure was kindling again in Ron’s eyes, but Hermione answered before Harry could.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Go to Dumbledore. That’s what we should have done ages ago. If we try anything ourselves we’ll be thrown out for sure.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“But we’ve got no <i class="calibre1">proof</i>!” said Harry. “Quirrell’s too scared to back us up. Snape’s only got to say he doesn’t know how the troll got in at Halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor — who do you think they’ll believe, him or us? It’s not exactly a secret we hate him, Dumbledore’ll think we made it up to get him sacked. Filch wouldn’t help us if his life depended on it, he’s too friendly with Snape, and the more students get thrown out, the better, he’ll think. And don’t forget, we’re not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy. That’ll take a lot of explaining.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Hermione looked convinced, but Ron didn’t.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“If we just do a bit of poking around —”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“No,” said Harry flatly, “we’ve done enough poking around.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">He pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of its moons.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6"> </span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">The following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, Hermione, and Neville at the breakfast table. They were all the same:</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6"> </span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc11">Your detention will take place at eleven o’clock tonight.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc11">Meet Mr. Filch in the entrance hall.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc11">Professor M. McGonagall</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6"> </span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points they’d lost. He half expected Hermione to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost, but she didn’t say a word. Like Harry, she felt they deserved what they’d got.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">At eleven o’clock that night, they said good-bye to Ron in the common room and went down to the entrance hall with Neville. Filch was already there — and so was Malfoy. Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had gotten a detention, too.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Follow me,” said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading them outside.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“I bet you’ll think twice about breaking a school rule again, won’t you, eh?” he said, leering at them. “Oh yes … hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask me. … It’s just a pity they let the old punishments die out … hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days, I’ve got the chains still in my office, keep ’em well oiled in case they’re ever needed. … Right, off we go, and don’t think of running off, now, it’ll be worse for you if you do.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">They marched off across the dark grounds. Neville kept sniffing. Harry wondered what their punishment was going to be. It must be something really horrible, or Filch wouldn’t be sounding so delighted.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">The moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them into darkness. Ahead, Harry could see the lighted windows of Hagrid’s hut. Then they heard a distant shout.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Is that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get started.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry’s heart rose; if they were going to be working with Hagrid it wouldn’t be so bad. His relief must have showed in his face, because Filch said, “I suppose you think you’ll be enjoying yourself with that oaf? Well, think again, boy — it’s into the forest you’re going and I’m much mistaken if you’ll all come out in one piece.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">At this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy stopped dead in his tracks.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“The forest?” he repeated, and he didn’t sound quite as cool as usual. “We can’t go in there at night — there’s all sorts of things in there — werewolves, I heard.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Neville clutched the sleeve of Harry’s robe and made a choking noise.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“That’s your problem, isn’t it?” said Filch, his voice cracking with glee. “Should’ve thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble, shouldn’t you?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark, Fang at his heel. He was carrying his large crossbow, and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Abou’ time,” he said. “I bin waitin’ fer half an hour already. <span class="GramE1">All right, Harry, Hermione?”</span></span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“I shouldn’t be too friendly to them, Hagrid,” said Filch coldly, “they’re here to be punished, after all.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“That’s why yer late, is it?” said Hagrid, frowning at Filch. “Bin lecturin’ them, eh? ’Snot your place ter do that. Yeh’ve done yer bit, I’ll take over from here.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“I’ll be back at dawn,” said Filch, “for what’s left of them,” he added nastily, and he turned and started back toward the castle, his lamp bobbing away in the darkness.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Malfoy now turned to Hagrid.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“I’m not going in that forest,” he said, and Harry was pleased to hear the note of panic in his voice.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Yeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts,” said Hagrid fiercely. “Yeh’ve done wrong an’ now yeh’ve got ter pay fer it.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“But this is servant <span class="GramE1">stuff,</span> it’s not for students to do. I thought we’d be copying lines or something, if my father knew I was doing this, he’d —”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“— tell yer that’s how it is at Hogwarts,” Hagrid growled. <span class="GramE1">“Copyin’ lines!</span> What good’s that ter anyone? Yeh’ll do summat useful or yeh’ll get out. If yeh think yer father’d rather you were expelled, <span class="GramE1">then</span> get back off ter the castle an’ pack. Go on!”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Malfoy didn’t move. He looked at Hagrid furiously, but then dropped his gaze.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Right then,” said Hagrid, “now, listen carefully, ’cause it’s dangerous what we’re gonna do tonight, an’ I don’ want no one takin’ risks. Follow me over here a moment.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">He led them to the very edge of the forest. Holding his lamp up high, he pointed down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black trees. A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the forest.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Look there,” said Hagrid, “see that stuff shinin’ on the ground? <span class="GramE1">Silvery stuff?</span> That’s unicorn blood. There’s a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat. This is the second time in a week. I found one dead last Wednesday. We’re gonna try an’ find the poor thing. We might have ter put it out of its misery.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first?” said Malfoy, unable to keep the fear out of his voice.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“There’s nothin’ that lives in the forest that’ll hurt yeh if yer with me or Fang,” said Hagrid. “An’ keep ter the path. Right, now, we’re gonna split inter two parties an’ follow the trail in diff’rent directions. There’s blood all over the place, it must’ve bin staggerin’ around since last night at least.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“I want Fang,” said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang’s long teeth.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“All right, but I warn yeh, he’s a coward,” said Hagrid. “So <span class="GramE1">me</span>, Harry, an’ Hermione’ll go one way an’ Draco, Neville, an’ Fang’ll go the other. Now, if any of us finds the unicorn, we’ll send up green sparks, right? Get yer wands out an’ practice now — that’s it — an’ if anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks, an’ we’ll all come an’ find yeh — so, be careful — let’s go.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">The forest was black and silent. A little way into it they reached a fork in the earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang took the right.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">They walked in silence, their eyes on the ground. Every now and then a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver-blue blood on the fallen leaves.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“<i class="calibre1">Could</i> a werewolf be killing the unicorns?” Harry asked.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Not fast enough,” said Hagrid. “It’s not easy ter catch a unicorn, they’re powerful magic creatures. I never knew one ter be hurt before.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">They walked past a mossy tree stump. Harry could hear running water; there must be a stream somewhere close by. There were still spots of unicorn blood here and there along the winding path.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“You all right, Hermione?” Hagrid whispered. “Don’ worry, it can’t’ve gone far if it’s this badly hurt, an’ then we’ll be able ter — GET BEHIND THAT TREE!”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off the path behind a towering oak. He pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow, raising it, ready to fire. The three of them listened. Something was slithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground. Hagrid was squinting up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound faded away.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“I knew it,” he murmured. “There’s summat in here that shouldn’ be.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="GramE3">“A werewolf?”</span> <span class="sgc6">Harry suggested.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“That wasn’ no werewolf an’ it wasn’ no unicorn, neither,” said Hagrid grimly. “Right, follow me, but careful, now.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">They walked more slowly, ears straining for the faintest sound. Suddenly, in a clearing ahead, something definitely moved.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Who’s there?” Hagrid called. “Show yerself — I’m armed!”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">And into the clearing came — was it a man, or a horse? To the waist, a man, with red hair and beard, but below that was a horse’s gleaming chestnut body with a long, reddish tail. Harry and Hermione’s jaws dropped.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Oh, it’s you, Ronan,” said Hagrid in relief. “How are yeh?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">He walked forward and shook the centaur’s hand.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Good evening to you, Hagrid,” said Ronan. He had a deep, sorrowful voice. “Were you going to shoot me?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Can’t be too careful, Ronan,” said Hagrid, patting his crossbow. “There’s summat bad loose in this forest. This is Harry Potter an’ Hermione Granger, by the way. <span class="GramE1">Students up at the school.</span> An’ this is Ronan, you two. He’s a centaur.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“We’d noticed,” said Hermione faintly.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Good evening,” said Ronan. “Students, are you? And do you learn much, up at the school?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Erm —”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“A bit,” said Hermione timidly.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="GramE3">“A bit.</span> <span class="sgc6">Well, that’s something.” Ronan sighed. He flung back his head and stared at the sky. “Mars is bright tonight.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Yeah,” said Hagrid, glancing up, too. “Listen, I’m glad we’ve run inter yeh, Ronan, ’cause there’s a unicorn bin hurt — you seen anythin’?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Ronan didn’t answer immediately. He stared unblinkingly upward, <span class="GramE1">then</span> sighed again.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Always the innocent are the first victims,” he said. “So it has been for ages past, so it is now.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Yeah,” said Hagrid, “but have yeh seen anythin’, Ronan? <span class="GramE1">Anythin’ unusual?”</span></span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Mars is bright tonight,” Ronan repeated, while Hagrid watched him impatiently. <span class="GramE1">“Unusually bright.”</span></span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Yeah, but I was meanin’ anythin’ unusual a bit nearer home,” said Hagrid. “So yeh haven’t noticed anythin’ strange?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Yet again, Ronan took a while to answer. At last, he said, “The forest hides many secrets.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="GramE3">A movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise</span> <span class="sgc6">his bow again, but it was only a second centaur, black-haired and -bodied and wilder-looking than Ronan.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Hullo, Bane,” said Hagrid. <span class="GramE1">“All right?”</span></span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Good evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Well enough. Look, I’ve jus’ bin askin’ Ronan, you seen anythin’ odd in here lately? There’s a unicorn bin injured — would yeh know anythin’ about it?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Bane walked over to stand next to Ronan. He looked skyward.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Mars is bright tonight,” he said simply.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“We’ve heard,” said Hagrid grumpily. “Well, if either of you do see anythin’, let me know, won’t yeh? We’ll be off, then.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing, staring over their shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked their view.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Never,” said Hagrid irritably, “try an’ get a straight answer out of a centaur. <span class="GramE1">Ruddy stargazers.</span> Not interested in anythin’ closer’n the moon.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Are there many of <i class="calibre1">them</i> in here?” asked Hermione.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="GramE3">“Oh, a fair few.</span> <span class="sgc6">… Keep themselves to themselves mostly, but they’re good enough about turnin’ up if ever I want a word. They’re deep, mind, centaurs … they know things … jus’ don’ let on much.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“D’you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?” said Harry.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Did that sound like hooves to you? Nah, if yeh ask me, that was what’s bin killin’ the unicorns — never heard anythin’ like it before.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">They walked on through the dense, dark trees. Harry kept looking nervously over his shoulder. He had the nasty feeling they were being watched. He was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them. They had just passed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Hagrid’s arm.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="GramE3">“Hagrid!</span> <span class="sgc6">Look! Red sparks, the others are in trouble!”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“You two wait here!” Hagrid shouted. “Stay on the <span class="GramE1">path,</span> I’ll come back for yeh!”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">They heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking at each other, very scared, until they couldn’t hear anything but the rustling of leaves around them.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“You don’t think they’ve been hurt, do you?” whispered Hermione.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“I don’t care if Malfoy has, but if something’s got Neville … it’s our fault he’s here in the first place.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">The minutes dragged by. Their ears seemed sharper than usual. Harry’s seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every cracking twig. What was going on? Where were the others?</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">At last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid’s return. Malfoy, Neville, and Fang were with him. Hagrid was fuming. Malfoy, it seemed, had sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke. Neville had panicked and sent up the sparks.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“We’ll be lucky ter catch anythin’ now, with the racket you two were makin’. Right, we’re changin’ groups — Neville, you stay with me an’ Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang an’ this idiot. I’m sorry,” Hagrid added in a whisper to Harry, “but he’ll have a harder time frightenin’ you, an’ we’ve gotta get this done.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang. They walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick. Harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker. There were splashes on the roots of a tree, as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by. Harry could see a clearing ahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient oak.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Look —” he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Malfoy.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Something bright white was gleaming on the ground. They inched closer.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">It was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry had never seen anything so beautiful and sad. Its long, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on the dark leaves.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood. A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered. … Then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure reached the unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the <span class="GramE1">animals</span> side, and began to drink its blood.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="GramE3">“AAAAAAAAAAARGH!”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted — so did Fang. The hooded figure raised its head and looked right at Harry — unicorn blood was dribbling down its front. It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry — he couldn’t move for fear.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Then a pain like he’d never felt before pierced his head; it was as though his scar were on fire. Half blinded, he staggered backward. He heard hooves behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over Harry, charging at the figure.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">The pain in Harry’s head was so bad he fell to his knees. It took a minute or two to pass. When he looked up, the figure had gone. A centaur was standing over him, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked younger; he had white-blond hair and a palomino body.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Are you all right?” said the centaur, pulling Harry to his feet.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Yes — thank you — what <i class="calibre1">was</i> that?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">The centaur didn’t answer. He had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale sapphires. He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out, livid, on Harry’s forehead.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“You are the Potter boy,” he said. “You had better get back to Hagrid. The forest is not safe at this time — especially for you. Can you ride? It will be quicker this way.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“My name is Firenze,” he added, as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that Harry could clamber onto his back.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">There was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing. Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees, their flanks heaving and sweaty.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="GramE3">“Firenze!”</span> <span class="sgc6">Bane thundered. “What are you doing? You have a human on your back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Do you realize who this is?” said Firenze. “This is the Potter boy. The quicker he leaves this forest, the better.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“What have you been telling him?” growled Bane. “Remember, Firenze, we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Ronan pawed the ground nervously. “I’m sure Firenze thought he was acting for the best,” he said in his gloomy voice.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Bane kicked his back legs in anger.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="GramE3">“For the best!</span> <span class="sgc6">What is that to do with us? Centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold! It is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest!”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that Harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Do you not see that unicorn?” Firenze bellowed at Bane. “Do you not understand why it was killed? Or have the planets not let you in on that secret? I set myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane, yes, with humans alongside me if I must.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">And Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best he could, they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind them.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry didn’t have a clue what was going on.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Why’s Bane so angry?” he asked. “What was that thing you saved me from, anyway?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Firenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his head bowed in case of low-hanging branches, but did not answer Harry’s question. They made their way through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought Firenze didn’t want to talk to him anymore. They were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used for?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“No,” said Harry, startled by the odd question. “We’ve only used the horn and tail hair in Potions.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn,” said Firenze. “Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. You have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your lips.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry stared at the back of Firenze’s head, which was dappled silver in the moonlight.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“But who’d be that desperate?” he wondered aloud. “If you’re going to be cursed forever, death’s better, isn’t it?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“It is,” Firenze agreed, “unless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else — something that will bring you back to full strength and power — something that will mean you can never die. Mr. Potter, do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="GramE3">“The Sorcerer’s Stone!</span> <span class="sgc6">Of course — the Elixir of Life! But I don’t understand who —”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power, <span class="GramE1">who</span> has clung to life, awaiting their chance?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">It was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harry’s heart. Over the rustling of the trees, he seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told him on the night they had met: “Some say he died. <span class="GramE1">Codswallop, in my opinion.</span> Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Do you mean,” Harry croaked, “that was <i class="calibre1">Vol</i> —”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Harry! Harry, are you all right?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Hermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing along behind her.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“I’m fine,” said Harry, hardly knowing what he was saying. “The unicorns dead, Hagrid, it’s in that clearing back there.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“This is where I leave you,” Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn. “You are safe now.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry slid off his back.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Good luck, Harry Potter,” said Firenze. “The planets have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those times.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">He turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving Harry shivering behind him.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6"> </span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them to return. He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him awake. In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide-eyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what had happened in the forest.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry couldn’t sit down. He paced up and down in front of the fire. He was still shaking.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Snape wants the Stone for Voldemort … and Voldemort’s waiting in the forest … and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get rich. …”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Stop saying the name!” said Ron in a terrified whisper, as if he thought Voldemort could hear them.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry wasn’t listening.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Firenze saved me, but he shouldn’t have done so. … Bane was furious … he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen. … They must show that Voldemort’s coming back. … Bane thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me. … I suppose that’s written in the stars as well.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“<i class="calibre1">Will you stop saying the <span class="GramE1">name<span class="sgc13">!</span></span></i>” Ron hissed.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“So all I’ve got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone,” Harry went on feverishly, “then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off. … Well, I suppose Bane’ll be happy.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Hermione looked very frightened, but she had a word of comfort.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Harry, everyone says Dumbledore’s the only one You-Know-Who was ever afraid of. With Dumbledore around, You-Know-Who won’t touch you. Anyway, who says the centaurs are right? It sounds like fortune-telling to me, and Professor McGonagall says that’s a very imprecise branch of magic.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">The sky had turned light before they stopped talking. They went to bed exhausted, their throats sore. But the night’s surprises weren’t over.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">When Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his Invisibility Cloak folded neatly underneath them. There was a note pinned to it:</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6"> </span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal1"><span class="sgc6">Just in case.</span></p>
