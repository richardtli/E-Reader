    <h1 class="sgc8" id="heading_id_2">The Sorting Hat</h1>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"> </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">The door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green robes stood there. She had a very stern face and Harry’s first thought was that this was not someone to cross.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“The firs’ years, Professor McGonagall,” said Hagrid.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">She pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys’ house in it. The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor. Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right — the rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering about nervously.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. “The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your House will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House common room.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose House points. At the end of the year, the House with the most points is awarded the House cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever House becomes yours.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville’s cloak, which was fastened under his left ear, and on Ron’s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to flatten his hair.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“I shall return when we are ready for you,” said Professor McGonagall. “Please wait quietly.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">She left the chamber. Harry swallowed.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“How exactly do they sort us into Houses?” he asked Ron.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was joking.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry’s heart gave a horrible jolt. <span class="GramE1">A test?</span> <span class="GramE1">In front of the whole school?</span> But he didn’t know any magic yet — what on earth would he have to do? He hadn’t expected something like this the moment they arrived. He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too. No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all the spells she’d learned and wondering which one she’d need. Harry tried hard not to listen to her. He’d never been more nervous, never, not even when he’d had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he’d somehow turned his teachers wig blue. He kept his eyes fixed on the door. Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air — several people behind him screamed.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“What the <span class="GramE1">— ?”</span></span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">He gasped. So did the people around him. About twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall. Pearly-white and slightly transparent, they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years. They seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fat little monk was saying: “Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance —”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“My dear Friar, haven’t we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and you know, he’s not really even a ghost — I say<span class="GramE1">,</span> what are you all doing here?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Nobody answered.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“New students!” said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them. “About to be Sorted, I suppose?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">A few people nodded mutely.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!” said the Friar. “My old House, you know.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Move along now,” said a sharp voice. “The Sorting Ceremony’s about to start.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Now, form a line,” Professor McGonagall told the first years, “and follow me.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting. Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them. The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students, the ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard Hermione whisper, “It’s bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read about it in <i class="calibre1">Hogwarts, <span class="GramE1">A</span> History.</i>”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the Great Hall didn’t simply open on to the heavens.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool she put a pointed wizard’s hat. This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn’t have let it in the house.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><i class="calibre1"><span class="sgc6">Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it,</span></i> <span class="sgc6">Harry thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing — noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there was complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth — and the hat began to sing:</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6"> </span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“<i class="calibre1">Oh, you may not think I’m pretty,</i></span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal6"><span class="sgc6">But don’t judge on what you see,</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal6"><span class="sgc6">I’ll eat myself if you can find</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="GramE4">A smarter hat than me.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal6"><span class="sgc6">You can keep your bowlers black,</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal6"><span class="sgc6">Your top hats sleek and tall,</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal6"><span class="sgc6">For I’m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal6"><span class="sgc6">And I can cap them all.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal6"><span class="sgc6">There’s nothing hidden in your head</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal6"><span class="sgc6">The Sorting Hat can’t see,</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal6"><span class="sgc6">So try me on and I will tell you</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="GramE4">Where you ought to be.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal6"><span class="sgc6">You might belong in Gryffindor,</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal6"><span class="sgc6">Where dwell the brave at heart,</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal6"><span class="sgc6">Their daring, nerve, and chivalry</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal6"><span class="sgc6">Set Gryffindors apart;</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal6"><span class="sgc6">You might belong in Hufflepuff,</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal6"><span class="sgc6">Where they are just and loyal,</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal6"><span class="sgc6">Those patient Hufflepuffs are true</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal6"><span class="sgc6">And unafraid of toil;</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal6"><span class="sgc6">Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw,</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal6"><span class="sgc6">If you’ve a ready mind,</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal6"><span class="sgc6">Where those of wit and learning,</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal6"><span class="sgc6">Will always find their kind;</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal6"><span class="sgc6">Or perhaps in Slytherin</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal6"><span class="sgc6">You’ll make your real friends,</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal6"><span class="sgc6">Those cunning folk use any means</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="GramE4">To achieve their ends.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><i class="calibre1"><span class="sgc6">So put me on! Don’t be afraid</span></i><span class="sgc6">!</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><i class="calibre1"><span class="sgc6">And don’t get in a flap</span></i><span class="sgc6">!</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal6"><span class="sgc6">You’re in safe hands (though I have none)</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><i class="calibre1"><span class="sgc6">For I’m a Thinking Cap</span></i><span class="sgc6">!”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6"> </span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“So we’ve just got to try on the hat!” Ron whispered to Harry. “I’ll kill <span class="GramE1">Fred,</span> he was going on about wrestling a troll.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching. The hat seemed to be asking rather a lot; Harry didn’t feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment. If only the hat had mentioned a House for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted,” she said. “Abbott, Hannah!”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moment’s pause —</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“HUFFLEPUFF!” shouted the hat.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Bones, Susan!”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“HUFFLEPUFF!” shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next to Hannah.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Boot, Terry!”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="GramE3">“RAVENCLAW!”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">The table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Brocklehurst, Mandy” went to Ravenclaw too, but “Brown, Lavender” became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron’s twin brothers catcalling.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Bulstrode, Millicent” then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was Harry’s imagination, after all he’d heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">He was starting to feel definitely sick now. He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school. He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Finch-Fletchley, Justin!”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="GramE3">“HUFFLEPUFF!”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the House at once, but at others it took a little while to decide. “Finnigan, Seamus,” the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Granger, Hermione!”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“GRYFFINDOR!” shouted the hat. Ron groaned.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when you’re very nervous. What if he wasn’t chosen at all? What if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he’d better get back on the train?</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">When Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called, he fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a long time to decide with Neville. When it finally shouted, “GRYFFINDOR,” Neville ran off still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to “MacDougal, Morag.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, “SLYTHERIN!”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with <span class="GramE1">himself</span>.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">There weren’t many people left now.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Moon” <span class="GramE1">… ,</span> “Nott” … , “Parkinson” … , then a pair of twin girls, “Patil” and “Patil” … , then “Perks, Sally-Anne” … , and then, at last —</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Potter, Harry!”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“<i class="calibre1">Potter,</i> did she say?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="GramE3">“<i class="calibre1">The</i> Harry Potter?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Hmm,” said a small voice in his ear. “Difficult. <span class="GramE1">Very difficult.</span> Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There’s talent, oh my goodness, yes — and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that’s interesting. … So where shall I put you?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, <i class="calibre1">Not Slytherin, not Slytherin.</i></span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Not Slytherin, eh?” said the small voice. “Are you sure? You could be great, you know, it’s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that — no? Well, if you’re sure — better be GRYFFINDOR!”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in <span class="GramE1">Slytherin,</span> he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, “We got Potter! We got Potter!” Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he’d seen earlier. The ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he’d just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">He could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned back. And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card he’d gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore’s silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. Harry spotted Professor Quirrell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">And now there were only four people left to be sorted. “Thomas, Dean,” a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table. “Turpin, Lisa,” became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron’s turn. He was pale green by now. Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted, “GRYFFINDOR!”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to him.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Well done, Ron, excellent,” said Percy Weasley pompously across Harry as “Zabini, Blaise,” was made a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just realized how hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Welcome!” he said. “Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Thank you!”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">He sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Harry didn’t know whether to laugh or not.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Is he — a bit mad?” he asked Percy uncertainly.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Mad?” said Percy airily. “He’s a genius! Best wizard in the world! But he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry’s mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now piled with food. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he’d never been allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if it made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat. It was all delicious.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“That does look good,” said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry cut up his steak.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Can’t you <span class="GramE1">— ?”</span></span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“I haven’t eaten for nearly five hundred years,” said the ghost. “I don’t need to, of course, but one does miss it. I don’t think I’ve introduced myself? <span class="GramE1">Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service.</span> <span class="GramE1">Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.”</span></span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“I know who you are!” said Ron suddenly. “My brothers told me about you — you’re Nearly Headless Nick!”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“I would <i class="calibre1">prefer</i> you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy —” the ghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="GramE3">“<i class="calibre1">Nearly</i> Headless?</span> <span class="sgc6">How can you be <i class="calibre1">nearly</i> headless?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn’t going at all the way he wanted.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Like <i class="calibre1">this,</i>” he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge. Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, “So — new Gryffindors! I hope you’re going to help us win the House Championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron’s becoming almost unbearable — he’s the Slytherin ghost.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood. He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to see, didn’t look too pleased with the seating arrangements.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“How did he get covered in blood?” asked Seamus with great interest.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“I’ve never asked,” said Nearly Headless Nick delicately.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">When everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. A moment later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate éclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding …</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“I’m half-and-half,” said Seamus. “Me dad’s a Muggle. Mom didn’t tell him she was a witch ’til after they were married. Bit of a nasty shock for him.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">The others laughed.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“What about you, Neville?” said Ron.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Well, my gran brought me up and she’s a witch,” said Neville, “but the family thought I was all-Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me — he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned — but nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced — all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here — they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">On Harry’s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (“I <i class="calibre1">do</i> hope they start right away, there’s so much to learn, I’m particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it’s supposed to be very difficult —”; “You’ll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing —”).</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet.</span> <span class="sgc6">Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">It happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell’s turban straight into Harry’s eyes — and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry’s forehead.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Ouch!” Harry clapped a hand to his head.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“What is it?” asked Percy.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="GramE3">“N-nothing.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">The pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teachers look — a feeling that he didn’t like Harry at all.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Who’s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?” he asked Percy.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he’s looking so nervous, that’s Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn’t want to — everyone knows he’s after Quirrell’s job. <span class="GramE1">Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape.”</span></span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn’t look at him again.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Ahem — just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Dumbledore’s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their House teams should contact Madam Hooch.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“And finally, I must tell you that this <span class="GramE1">year,</span> the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“He’s not serious?” he muttered to Percy.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Must be,” said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. “It’s odd, because he usually gives us a reason why we’re not allowed to go somewhere — the forest’s full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he might have told us prefects, at least.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!” cried Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachers’ smiles had become rather fixed.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which <span class="GramE1">rose</span> high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Everyone pick their favorite tune,” said Dumbledore, “and off we go!”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">And the school bellowed:</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6"> </span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“<i class="calibre1">Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts,</i></span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal6"><span class="sgc6">Teach us something please,</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal6"><span class="sgc6">Whether we be old and bald</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal6"><span class="sgc6">Or young with scabby knees,</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal6"><span class="sgc6">Our heads could do with filling</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal6"><span class="sgc6">With some interesting stuff,</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal6"><span class="sgc6">For now they’re bare and full of air,</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal6"><span class="sgc6">Dead flies and bits of fluff,</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal6"><span class="sgc6">So teach us things worth knowing,</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal6"><span class="sgc6">Bring back what we’ve forgot,</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal6"><span class="sgc6">Just do your best, we’ll do the rest,</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><i class="calibre1"><span class="sgc6">And learn until our brains all rot.</span></i><span class="sgc6">”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6"> </span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Everybody finished the song at different times. At last, only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march. Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Ah, music,” he said, wiping his eyes. “A magic beyond all we do here! <span class="GramE1">And now, bedtime.</span> Off you trot!”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harry’s legs were like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food. He was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries. They climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Peeves,” Percy whispered to the first years. <span class="GramE1">“A poltergeist.”</span> He raised his voice, “Peeves — show yourself.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross-legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Oooooooh!” he said, with an evil cackle. <span class="GramE1">“Ickle Firsties!</span> What <span class="GramE1">fun!</span>”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">He swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Go away, Peeves, or the Baron’ll hear about this, I mean it!” barked Percy.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on Neville’s head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“You want to watch out for Peeves,” said Percy, as they set off again. “The Bloody Baron’s the only one who can control him, he won’t even listen to us prefects. Here we are.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Password?” she said.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Caput Draconis,” said Percy, and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all scrambled through it — Neville needed a leg up — and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another. At the top of a spiral staircase — they were obviously in one of the towers — they found their beds at last: five four-posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their trunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Great food, isn’t it?” Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings. “Get <i class="calibre1">off,</i> Scabbers! He’s chewing my sheets.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry was going to ask Ron if he’d had any of the treacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange dream. He was wearing Professor Quirrell’s turban, which kept talking to him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was his destiny. Harry told the turban he didn’t want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully — and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it — then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold — there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">He rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he didn’t remember the dream at all.</span></p>
