    <h1 class="sgc8" id="heading_id_2">Halloween</h1>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"> </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Malfoy couldn’t believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful. Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“It’s either really valuable or really dangerous,” said Ron.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Or both,” said Harry.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long, they didn’t have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going near the dog again.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone’s attention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls. Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor. They had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said:</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6"> </span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc11">DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc11">It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don’t want everybody knowing you’ve got a broomstick or they’ll all want one. Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o’clock for your first training session.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc11">Professor M. McGonagall</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6"> </span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to read.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="GramE3">“A Nimbus Two Thousand!”</span> <span class="sgc6">Ron moaned enviously. “I’ve never even <i class="calibre1">touched</i> one.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">They left the hall quickly, wanting to <span class="GramE1">unwrap</span> the broomstick in private before their first class, but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy seized the package from Harry and felt it.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“That’s a broomstick,” he said, throwing it back to Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face. “You’ll be in for it this time, Potter, first years aren’t allowed them.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Ron couldn’t resist it.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“It’s not any old broomstick,” he said, “<span class="GramE1">it’s</span> a Nimbus Two Thousand. What did you say you’ve got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?” Ron grinned at Harry. “Comets look flashy, but they’re not in the same league as the Nimbus.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“What would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn’t afford half the handle,” Malfoy snapped back. “I suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoy’s elbow.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Not arguing, I hope, boys?” he squeaked.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Potters been sent a broomstick, Professor,” said Malfoy quickly.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Yes, yes, that’s right,” said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry. “Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances, Potter. And what model is it?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“A Nimbus Two Thousand, sir,” said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy’s face. “And it’s really thanks to Malfoy here that I’ve got it,” he added.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at Malfoy’s obvious rage and confusion.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Well, it’s true,” Harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase, “If he hadn’t stolen Neville’s Remembrall I wouldn’t be on the team. …”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“So I suppose you think that’s a reward for breaking rules?” <span class="GramE1">came</span> an angry voice from just behind them. Hermione was stomping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry’s hand.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“I thought you weren’t speaking to us?” said Harry.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Yes, don’t stop <span class="GramE1">now,</span>” said Ron, “it’s doing us so much good.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Hermione marched away with her nose in the air.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day. It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he’d be learning to play that night. He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Wow,” Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry’s bedspread.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold near the top.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">As seven o’clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field. He’d never been inside the stadium before. Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on. At either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground. What a feeling — he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Hey, Potter, come down!”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Oliver Wood had arrived. He was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm. Harry landed next to him.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Very nice,” said Wood, his eyes glinting. “I see what McGonagall meant … you really are a natural. I’m just going to teach you the rules this evening, <span class="GramE1">then</span> you’ll be joining team practice three times a week.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">He opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized balls.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Right,” said Wood. “Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even if it’s not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side. Three of them are called Chasers.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Three Chasers,” Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“This ball’s called the Quaffle,” said Wood. “The Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal. Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops. Follow me?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score,” Harry recited. “So — that’s sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn’t it?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“What’s basketball?” said Wood curiously.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Never mind,” said Harry quickly.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Now, there’s another player on each side who’s called the Keeper — I’m Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Three Chasers, one Keeper,” said Harry, who was determined to remember it all. “And they play with the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are they for?” He pointed at the three balls left inside the box.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“I’ll show you now,” said Wood. “Take this.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“I’m going to show you what the Bludgers do,” Wood said. “These two are the Bludgers.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than the red Quaffle. Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Stand back,” Wood warned Harry. He bent down and freed one of the Bludgers.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">At once, the black ball <span class="GramE1">rose</span> high in the air and then pelted straight at Harry’s face. Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air — it zoomed around their heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“See?” Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely. “The Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off their brooms. That’s why you have two Beaters on each team — the Weasley twins are ours — it’s their job to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team. So — think you’ve got all that?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the goal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team,” Harry reeled off.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Very good,” said Wood.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Er — have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?” Harry asked, hoping he sounded offhand.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="GramE3">“Never at Hogwarts.</span> <span class="sgc6">We’ve had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that. Now, the last member of the team is the Seeker. That’s you. And you don’t have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgers —”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="GramE3">“— unless they crack my head open.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Don’t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers — I mean<span class="GramE1">,</span> they’re like a pair of human Bludgers themselves.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball. Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a large walnut. It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“<i class="calibre1">This,</i>” said Wood, “is the Golden Snitch, and it’s the most important ball of the lot. It’s very hard to catch because it’s so fast and difficult to see. It’s the Seeker’s job to catch it. You’ve got to weave in and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it before the other team’s Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win. That’s why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages — I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Well, that’s it — any questions?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all <span class="GramE1">right,</span> it was doing it that was going to be the problem.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“We won’t practice with the Snitch yet,” said Wood, carefully shutting it back inside the crate, “it’s too dark, we might lose it. Let’s try you out with a few of these.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry didn’t miss a single one, and Wood was delighted. After half an hour, night had really fallen and they couldn’t carry on.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“That Quidditch Cup’ll have our name on it this year,” said Wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle. “I wouldn’t be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for England if he hadn’t gone off chasing dragons.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6"> </span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he’d already been at Hogwarts two months. The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had. His lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try since they’d seen him make Neville’s toad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice. Harry’s partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch his eye). Ron, however, was to be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this. She hadn’t spoken to either of them since the day Harry’s broomstick had arrived.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Now, don’t forget that nice wrist movement we’ve been practicing!” squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as usual. “Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the magic words properly is very important, too — never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said ‘s’ instead of ‘f’ and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">It was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop. Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it — Harry had to put it out with his hat.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Ron, at the next table, wasn’t having much more luck.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“<i class="calibre1">Wingardium Leviosa</i>!” he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“You’re saying it wrong,” Harry heard Hermione snap. “It’s Wing-<i class="calibre1">gar</i>-dium Levi-<i class="calibre1">o</i>-<span class="GramE1">sa,</span> make the ‘gar’ nice and long.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“You do it, then, if you’re so clever,” Ron snarled.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said, “<i class="calibre1">Wingardium Leviosa</i>!”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Oh, well done!” cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. “Everyone see here, Miss Granger’s done it!”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“It’s no wonder no one can stand her,” he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor, “she’s a nightmare, honestly.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was Hermione. Harry caught a glimpse of her face — and was startled to see that she was in tears.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“I think she heard you.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“So?” said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. “She must’ve noticed she’s got no friends.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Hermione didn’t turn up for the next class and wasn’t seen all afternoon. On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls’ bathroom and wanted to be left alone. Ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of their minds.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term banquet.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face. Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore’s chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, “Troll — in the dungeons — thought you ought to know.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">He then sank to the floor in a dead faint.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">There was <span class="GramE1">an uproar</span>. It took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of Professor Dumbledore’s wand to bring silence.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Prefects,” he rumbled, “lead your Houses back to the dormitories immediately!”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Percy was in his element.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Follow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear the troll if you follow my orders! Stay close behind me, now. Make way, first years coming through! Excuse me, I’m a prefect!”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“How could a troll get in?” Harry asked as they climbed the stairs.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Don’t ask me, they’re supposed to be really stupid,” said Ron. “Maybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">They passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions. As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly grabbed Ron’s arm.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“I’ve just thought — Hermione.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“What about her?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“She doesn’t know about the troll.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Ron bit his lip.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Oh, all right,” he snapped. “But Percy’d better not see us.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Ducking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way, slipped down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the girls’ bathroom. They had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Percy!” hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He crossed the corridor and disappeared from view.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“What’s he doing?” Harry whispered. “Why isn’t he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Search me.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Quietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after Snape’s fading footsteps.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“He’s heading for the third floor,” Harry said, but Ron held up his hand.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Can you smell something?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">And then they heard it — a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet. Ron pointed — at the end of a passage to the left, something huge was moving toward them. They shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">It was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was <span class="GramE1">a dull</span>, granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was incredible. It was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. It waggled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, <span class="GramE1">then</span> slouched slowly into the room.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“The key’s in the lock,” Harry muttered. “We could lock it in.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Good idea,” said Ron nervously.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">They edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasn’t about to come out of it. With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key, slam the door, and lock it.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“<i class="calibre1">Yes</i>!”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Flushed with their victory, they started to run back up the passage, but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop — a high, petrified scream — and it was coming from the chamber they’d just chained up.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Oh, no,” said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“It’s the girls’ bathroom!” Harry gasped.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“<i class="calibre1">Hermione</i>!” they said together.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have? Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in their panic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if she was about to faint. The troll was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the walls as it went.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Confuse it!” Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap, he threw it as hard as he could against the wall.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It lumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what had made the noise. Its mean little eyes saw Harry. It hesitated, <span class="GramE1">then</span> made for him instead, lifting its club as it went.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Oy, pea-brain!” yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber, and he threw a metal pipe at it. The troll didn’t even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving Harry time to run around it.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Come on, run, <span class="GramE5">run</span>!” Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward the door, but she couldn’t move, she was still flat against the wall, her mouth open with terror.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk. It roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the troll’s neck from behind. The troll couldn’t feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and Harry’s wand had still been in his hand when he’d jumped — it had gone straight up one of the troll’s nostrils.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Howling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry clinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own wand — not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head: “<i class="calibre1">Wingardium Leviosa</i>!”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">The club flew suddenly out of the troll’s hand, rose high, high up into the air, turned slowly over — and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner’s head. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath. Ron was standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">It was Hermione who spoke first.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Is it — dead?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“I don’t think so,” said Harry, “I think it’s just been knocked out.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">He bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll’s nose. It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Urgh</span> <span class="sgc12" xml:lang="EN-AU">—</span> <span class="sgc6">troll boogers.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">He wiped it on the troll’s trousers.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up. They hadn’t realized what a racket they had been making, but of course, someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll’s roars. A moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room, closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell took one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Snape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and Harry. Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lips were white. Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry’s mind.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“What on earth were you thinking of?” said Professor McGonagall, with cold fury in her voice. Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing with his wand in the air. “You’re lucky you weren’t killed. Why aren’t you in your dormitory?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Snape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked at the floor. He wished Ron would put his wand down.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Then a small voice came out of the shadows.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Please, Professor McGonagall — they were looking for me.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Miss Granger!”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“I went looking for the troll because I — I thought I could deal with it on my own — you know, because I’ve read all about them.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Ron dropped his wand. <span class="GramE1">Hermione Granger, telling a downright lie to a teacher?</span></span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“If they hadn’t found me, I’d be dead now. Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club. They didn’t have time to come and fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they arrived.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn’t new to them.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Well — in that case …” said Professor McGonagall, staring at the three of them, “Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Hermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. Hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to get them out of trouble. It was as if Snape had started handing out sweets.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this,” said Professor McGonagall. “I’m very disappointed in you. If you’re not hurt at all, you’d better get off to Gryffindor Tower. Students are finishing the feast in their Houses.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Hermione left.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have taken on a full-grown mountain troll. You each win Gryffindor five points. Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">They hurried out of the chamber and didn’t speak at all until they had climbed two floors up. It was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll, quite apart from anything else.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“We should have gotten more than ten points,” Ron grumbled.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Five, you mean, once she’s taken off Hermione’s.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Good of her to get us out of trouble like that,” Ron admitted. “Mind you, we <i class="calibre1">did</i> save her.”</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“She might not have needed saving if we hadn’t locked the thing in with her,” Harry reminded him.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">They had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">“Pig snout,” they said and entered.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">The common room was packed and noisy. Everyone was eating the food that had been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting for them. There was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of them looking at each other, they all said “Thanks,” and hurried off to get plates.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal4"><span class="sgc6">But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can’t share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.</span></p>
